# Whole-slide CNN Training Pipeline

This repository provides scripts to reproduce the results in the paper "An annotation-free whole-slide training approach to pathological classification of lung cancer types by deep learning", including model training, inference, visualization, and statistics calculation, etc.
Also, the pipeline is seamlessly adaptable to other pathological cases by simply creating new configuration files.

## TCGA Pre-trained Model

A referenced pre-trained weight for lung cancer type classification is now available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XuONWICAzJ-cUKjC7uHLS0YLJhbLRoo1/view?usp=sharing.

The model was trained by TCGA-LUAD and TCGA-LUSC diagnostic slides specified in `data_configs/pure_tcga/train_pure_tcga.csv` using the config `train_configs/pure_tcga/config_pure_tcga_wholeslide_4x.yaml`.
Since no normal lung slides were provided in these data sets, the model predicts a slide as either adenocarcinoma (class_id=1) or squamous cell carcinoma (class_id=2).
The prediction scores for normal (class_id=0) should be ignored.

Validation results (*n* = 192) on `data_configs/pure_tcga/val_pure_tcga.csv` are listed as follow.

- AUC (LUAD vs LUSC) = **0.9794** (95% CI: 0.9635-0.9953)
- Accuracy (LUAD vs LUSC) = **0.9323** (95% CI: 0.8876-0.9600, @threshold = 0.7 for class1, 0.3 for class2)

## Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

Make sure the system contains adequate amount of main memory space (minimal: 256 GB, recommended: 512 GB) to prevent out-of-memory error.
For ones who would like to have a try with less concern about model accuracy, setting a lower resizing ratio and image size in configuration can drastically reduce memory consumption, friendly for limited computing resources.

### Packages

The codes are tested on the environment with Ubuntu 18.04 / CentOS 7.5, Python 3.7.3, cuda 10.0, cudnn 7.6 and Open MPI 4.0.1.
Some Python packages should be installed before running the scripts, including

- Tensorflow v1.x (tensorflow-gpu==1.15.3)
- Horovod (horovod==0.19.0)
- MPI for Python (mpi4py==3.0.3)
- OpenSlide 3.4.1 (https://github.com/openslide/openslide/releases/tag/v3.4.1)
- OpenSlide Python (openslide-python=1.1.1)
- Tensorflow Huge Model Support (our package)
- (optional) R 4.0.2 (https://www.r-project.org/)

Refer to requirements.txt for the full list.
The installation of these packages should take few minutes.

## Usage

### 1. Define Datasets

To initiate a training task, several CSV files, e.g. train.csv, val.csv and test.csv, should be prepared to define training, validation and testing datasets.

These CSV files should follow the format:
```
[slide_name_1],[class_id_1]
[slide_name_2],[class_id_2]
...
```
, where [slide_name_\*] specify the filename **without extension** of a slide image and [class_id_\*] is an integer indicating a slide-level label (e.g. 0 for normal, 1 for cancerous). 

The configuration files for our experiments are placed at data_configs/.

### 2. Set Up Training Configurations

Model hyper-parameters are set up in a YAML file. 

For convenience, you can copy one from train_configs/ (e.g. train_configs/config_wholeslide_2x.yaml) and make modifications for your own recipe.

The following table describes each field in a train_config.

### 3. Train a Model

To train a model, simply run
```
python -m whole_slide_cnn.train --config YOUR_TRAIN_CONFIG.YAML [--continue_mode]
```
, where `--continue_mode` is optional that makes the training process begin after loading the model weights.

To enable multi-node, multi-GPU distributed training, simply add `mpirun` in front of the above command, e.g.
```
mpirun -np 4 -x CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,2,3" python -m whole_slide_cnn.train --config YOUR_TRAIN_CONFIG.YAML
```

Note that you should `cd` to the root folder of this repo before calling the above commands.

Typically, this step takes days to complete, depending on the computing power, while you can trace the progress in real time from program output.

### 4. (Optional) Post-train Patch Aggregation Model for MIL

EM-MIL-SVM, EM-MIL-LR, MIL-RNN and CNN-MaxFeat-based RF involve training a second patch aggregation model, requiring users to run another script to initiate patch aggregation model training.
Just like the command above, simply call
```
[mpirun ...] python -m whole_slide_cnn.post_train --config YOUR_TRAIN_CONFIG.YAML 
```

### 5. Evaluate the Model

To evaluate the model or optionally generate prediction heatmap, call
```
[mpirun ...] python -m whole_slide_cnn.test --config YOUR_TRAIN_CONFIG.YAML
```

This command will generate a JSON file in the result directory named `test_result.json` by default.
The file contains the model predictions for each testing slide. 

To statistically analyze the results, some scripts are provided in tools/.
See the following table for the usage of each tool.
| Tool                  | Description                                     | Example
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------
| tools/calc_auc.R      | Calculate AUC and CI.                           | tools/calc_auc.R RESULT_DIR/test_result.json
| tools/compare_auc.R   | Testing significance of the AUCs of two models. | tools/compare_auc.R RESULT_DIR_1/test_result.json RESULT_DIR_2/test_result.json
| tools/draw_roc.py     | Draw the ROC diagram.                           | python tools/draw_roc.py test_result.json:MODEL_NAME:#FF0000
| tools/gen_bootstrap_aucs.R | Generate 100 AUCs by bootstrapping.        | tools/gen_bootstrap_aucs.R RESULT_DIR/test_result.json

Note that these tools are currently profiled for lung cancer maintype classification and should be modified when applying to your own tasks.

## Data Availability

The slide data from TMUH, WFH and SHH are not publicly available due to patient privacy constraints, but are available uponon reasonable request from the corresponding author Chao-Yuan Yeh or Cheng-Yu Chen. 
The slide data supporting the cross-site generalization capability in this study are obtained from TCGA via the Genomic Data Commons Data Portal (https://gdc.cancer.gov).

A dataset consists of several slides from TCGA-LUAD and TCGA-LUSC is suitable for testing our pipeline in small scale, with some proper modifications of configuration files described above.
